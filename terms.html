  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>The Power-Up allows you to import JSON and CSV files into Trello boards by creating cards. The Power-Up is provided as a tool to assist with data import and does not guarantee any specific outcome.</p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Backing up your Trello data before using the Power-Up</li>
    <li>Verifying the accuracy of imported data</li>
    <li>Ensuring your import files are properly formatted</li>
    <li>Maintaining the security of your Trello account</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="important">
    <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p><strong>THE POWER-UP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong></p>
    <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Power-Up will meet your specific requirements</li>
      <li>The Power-Up will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free</li>
      <li>The results from using the Power-Up will be accurate or reliable</li>
      <li>Any errors in the Power-Up will be corrected</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="important">
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY:</strong></p>
