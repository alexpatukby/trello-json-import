  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Last updated: December 2024</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>JSON/CSV Importer for Trello ("the Power-Up") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>The Power-Up collects and stores the following data locally in your Trello account using Trello's Power-Up storage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Import count:</strong> Number of imports performed (for free trial tracking)</li>
    <li><strong>License key:</strong> If you purchase a license, your license key is stored</li>
    <li><strong>Authorization token:</strong> A Trello API token to access your boards (stored securely in Trello's private member storage)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect personal information (name, email, address)</li>
    <li>We do not store your imported files or their contents</li>
    <li>We do not have access to your Trello boards or cards outside of the import session</li>
    <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
    <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally within Trello's Power-Up storage system, which is tied to your Trello account. We do not operate external servers that store your data.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Power-Up uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trello API:</strong> To create cards and lists on your boards</li>
    <li><strong>PapaParse (CDN):</strong> For parsing CSV files (no data is sent to external servers)</li>
    <li><strong>LemonSqueezy:</strong> For license purchases (subject to their privacy policy)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can remove the Power-Up from your Trello board at any time, which will stop all functionality. To delete stored data, remove the Power-Up from all your boards.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
